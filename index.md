**RC-QED** is a **R**eading **C**omprehension task that requires a system not only to output an answer, but also to explain a derivation process of the answer.
We named it after the Latin "quod erat demonstrandum (**QED**)" indicating the completion of a mathematical proof.
Given a question and supporting documents, your task is to identify the following:

- **Answerability** (answerable or not): whether (i) the question is answerable or not solely based on the documents
- **Derivations** (sequence of entity relations): an explanation as to why the answer can be derived from the documents
- **Answer** (entity): an answer to the question

For example, see the following picture:
